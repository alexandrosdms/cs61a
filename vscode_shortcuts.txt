Keyboard Shortcuts

VS Code has many, many keyboard shortcuts. Here are a few useful ones! (for Mac users, replace all the Ctrl sequences with cmd)

    Ctrl-` : open an integrated terminal in VS Code
    Ctrl-s : saves the current file
    Ctrl-x : cuts the entire line your cursor is on
    Ctrl-v : pastes the entire line you cut in the line above your cursor OR pastes the selected text in place
    Ctrl-z : undo
    Ctrl-shift-z : redo
    tab : indent a line or a group of lines
    shift-tab : dedent a line or a group of lines
    Ctrl-d : highlights the current word. For every Ctrl-d you type after this first word, it will highlight every next instance of the word. This allows you to easily rename variables with multiple cursors! (Play around with this one, it's fun and very practical!)
    Ctrl-tab : moves you to the next tab (Ctrl on Mac as well)
    Ctrl-shift-tab : moves you to the previous tab (Ctrl on Mac as well)
    Ctrl-f : search for a word
    Ctrl-shift-f : searches through all tabs
